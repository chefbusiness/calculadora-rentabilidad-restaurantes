        "question": "How often should I use this calculator?",
        "answer": "We recommend using the calculator monthly to monitor your restaurant's financial health. It's also useful when implementing significant changes to menu, prices, or cost structure to evaluate their impact on profitability."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I do if my COGS is above 30%?",
        "answer": "High COGS indicates you're spending too much on ingredients. Solutions: negotiate better prices with suppliers, reduce waste, control portions, optimize menu focusing on more profitable dishes, and review inventory to avoid excessive purchases."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I reduce labor costs without affecting quality?",
        "answer": "Optimize schedules according to demand, train staff for greater efficiency, evaluate if you need all current positions, consider technology to automate repetitive processes, and measure productivity by calculating sales per employee per hour."
      },
      {
        "question": "What net profit margin is healthy for a restaurant?",
        "answer": "A healthy net margin for restaurants is between 5-10%. Margins below 3% indicate problems requiring immediate attention. Margins above 10% are excellent and suggest a very efficient operation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I include tips in revenue?",
        "answer": "Yes, you should include officially declared tips in revenue, as they form part of the business's total income. However, undeclared tips or those going directly to staff should not be included in this calculation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does seasonality affect these calculations?",
        "answer": "Seasonality can significantly impact results. We recommend using data from the most representative month of your normal operation, or calculating an average of several months to get a more accurate view of your profitability."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between fixed and variable costs?",
        "answer": "Fixed costs don't change according to sales level (rent, insurance, licenses). Variable costs fluctuate with sales (marketing, delivery commissions, some supplies). Understanding this difference is key for financial planning."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator work for all types of restaurants?",
        "answer": "Yes, the calculator is designed to work with full-service restaurants, cafeterias, bars, food trucks, and catering services. Financial principles are universal, although ideal ranges may vary slightly depending on establishment type."
